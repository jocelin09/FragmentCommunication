# FragmentCommunication
Shows communication between fragment to fragment and fragment to activity.

##### <b> Attaching some screenshots: </b> 

<img src = "screenshots/image1.png" width = "250" />  <img src = "screenshots/image2.png" width = "250" />
<img src = "screenshots/image3.png" width = "250" />

So here we have one activity with 3 fragments :
- FragmentA (Grey b/g)
- FragmentB (Green b/g)
- FragmentC (Purple b/g)
